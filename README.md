Hi! I'm Gavin Schramm and I am a student at Doane University. I will graduate in May of 2026 with a Software Engineering major and a Data Analytics and Leadership Studies double minor. 
At Doane I am a part of the Programming Team, the Hansen Leadership Program and build scene sets in the Theatre department among many other activities on campus.

I use this GitHub account for some school work along side my personal projects so the repoâ€™s that start with CMP are from my classes. So far, my projects on here are Jeopardy which has a working version uploaded,
and Connect 4, named Connect, which is working.
